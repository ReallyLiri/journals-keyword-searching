  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The text appears to be a review of another book, 'How to Accept German Reparations' by Susan Slyomovics, written by Ilan Pappé. The content does not express any direct sentiment towards Israel. The mention of Pappé's own books and his role as professor of history at the University of Exeter is also neutral in terms of sentiment.""}
