  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The book 'After the Fact: The Seventh Million' by Tom Segev and Haim Watzman appears to be a historical analysis of Israel's response to the Holocaust, rather than expressing a specific positive or negative sentiment towards Israel as a country. The text does not contain overtly emotional language or biased opinions about Israel."}
