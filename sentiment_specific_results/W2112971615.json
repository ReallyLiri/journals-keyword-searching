  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The text does not contain any explicit statements about Israel, only a mention of 'Israeli Occupation' in one chapter title ('Palestinian Women under Israeli Occupation Implications for Development Souad Dajani'). The tone of the book appears to be academic and informative, rather than expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment towards Israel."
