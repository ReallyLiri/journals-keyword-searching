  "sentiment": "mixed",
  "reason": "The text presents a debate between a Palestinian lawyer, Jonathan Kuttab, and an Israeli professor, Edy Kaufman. While Kaufman's response seems to be neutral or even slightly positive (he is a professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem), Kuttab's original article has a critical tone towards Israel. Overall, the sentiment towards 'Israel' is mixed due to the opposing views expressed by the two authors."
