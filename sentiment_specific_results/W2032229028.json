  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The text appears to be a neutral, academic discussion of the Israeli kibbutzim and the Westermarck hypothesis, without any emotional or evaluative language towards 'Israel'. The authors' focus is on the psychological and sociological implications of early association, rather than expressing a sentiment towards Israel as a country."
