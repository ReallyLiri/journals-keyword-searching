  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The text discusses research on intergroup helping and social hierarchy, with no emotional language or tone towards 'Israel'. The authors' names (Lily Chernyak-Hai, Samer Halabi, Arie Nadler) also don't suggest any bias or sentiment. The topic of 'Justified dependency' and system justification is neutral in itself."}
