  "sentiment": "negative",
  "reason": "The title 'Exposing Oslo' and the subtitle 'The Obstruction of Peace: The United States, Israel, and the Palestinians' suggest that the book is critical of Israel's actions and policies, which is further reinforced by the use of words like 'obstruction' to describe its behavior. Additionally, the inclusion of the US and Palestinians in the title suggests that the book may be critical of these parties as well, but the focus on exposing Oslo implies a stronger negative sentiment towards Israel."
