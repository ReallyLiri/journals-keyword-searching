  "sentiment": "negative",
  "reason": "The text contains negative statements about Israel, such as the confiscation of Palestinian IDs at the whim of Israeli authorities, and the use of God as a real estate agent by Jewish groups and Christian fundamentalists to justify land grabs in the Old City.
