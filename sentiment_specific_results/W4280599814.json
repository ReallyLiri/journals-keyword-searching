  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The text discusses a sensitive topic (bereaved parents, fallen soldiers) in a neutral and academic tone, without expressing any emotional or evaluative language towards Israel. The focus is on the concept of 'lived memory' and its relation to public commemoration, rather than making any judgments or expressing opinions about Israel."
