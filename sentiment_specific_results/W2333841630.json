  "sentiment": "negative",
  "reason": "The text does not express a positive sentiment towards 'Israel'. The word 'violence' in the title, and phrases such as 'the power of the nation', 'national stereotypes', and 'unseen violence' suggest a critical tone towards Israel. Additionally, the author's analysis focuses on how Zionism photographs itself, implying that Israel is not being presented in a positive light."}
