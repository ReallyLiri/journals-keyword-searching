  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The title of the academic text, 'Arab-Israeli Conflict-Jewish-Transjordanian Relations 1921-1948', suggests a neutral stance on Israel as it does not express any emotional or evaluative language. The authors' use of terms like 'Conflict' and 'Relations' implies an objective analysis of the historical events rather than expressing a positive or negative sentiment towards Israel."}
