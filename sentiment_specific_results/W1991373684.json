  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The text does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment towards 'Israel'. The author describes Chomsky's views on Israel as a subject that can be exempt from rational analysis, but this statement is more about Chomsky's approach than the sentiment towards Israel itself. The text also mentions Arab familiarity with Israel being limited, which could imply a neutral tone."
