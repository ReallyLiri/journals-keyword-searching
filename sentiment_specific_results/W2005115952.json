  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The text does not contain any explicit positive or negative sentiments towards 'Israel'. The authors seem to be discussing the concept of a postnational Palestine/Israel, exploring globalization and diaspora's impact on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The tone is more analytical than emotive, which makes it neutral.""}
