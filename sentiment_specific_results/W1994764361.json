  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "reason": "The academic text 'Itineraries in Conflict' by Rebecca Stein does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment towards 'Israel'. The text appears to be an objective analysis of the political lives of tourism and its relationship with conflict, rather than making value judgments about Israel or any other entity. The focus is on the sociological and historical context of tourism and conflict, without explicitly expressing a positive or negative view towards Israel."}
